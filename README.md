# Convert_images_into_PDF
A simple script to convert a bunch of images into a PDF file with the possibility to compress it


Excute the script in the directory where the images you want to convert are. These images will be converted inside the directory you're in (where you executed the script).
I advise you to copy this script into /usr/local/bin to be able to call it from wherever directory you're in. Don't forget to enable the execution of this script before trying to use it.


  Use: makePdf.sh in the directory of your pictures to make a pdf from them. You will be asked a few questions:
      - If you want to delete the original pictures
      - To type the name of the output PDF file
      - If you want to compress the PDF file and if so, the quality compression
